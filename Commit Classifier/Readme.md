Challenge: Your challenge is to build a model capable of classifying build account activities from their activity patterns as identified from metrics collected about code commits. You are provided with a dataset in a CSV file, consisting of:
 
●	Static metric changes derived from commits (see glossary.txt for shorthand meanings)
●	A boolean flag labeling:
○	build account activity (true)
○	developer activity (false)

Major points:
how to deal missing data
how to deal outliers
how to deal correlation among features
feature extraction 
testing and validating
